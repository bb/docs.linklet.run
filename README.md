# Linklet - a serverless platform for building microservices

## Lightweight Microservices

Linklet is a lightweight solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to HTTP requests without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment. You can use HTTP invocation to trigger execution.

## Completely Serverless

Linklet run in a fully-managed, serverless environment in which we handle the servers, operating systems and runtime environments, and you focus on building great solutions.

## Automatic Scaling and Super-fast

Each Linklet service runs in its own isolated, secure execution context and its lifecycle is independent from other Linklets. Linklet services can scaled independently, and multiple instances of a service can concurrently process from other resources.

## Open and Familiar

Linklet functions are written in Javascript and execute in a standard Node.js runtime environment. You can take your Linklet functions and run it in any standard Node.js runtime which makes both portability and local testing a breeze. You can even deploy your Linklet function directly.

## HTTPS Invocation
Linklet functions deployed with an HTTP trigger are given a fully qualified domain together with a dynamically generated SSL/TLS certificate for secure communication.

## Logging & Monitoring
Logs generated from your Linklet functions are automatically written to our logging stack and performance telemetry is recorded in monitoring stack.
